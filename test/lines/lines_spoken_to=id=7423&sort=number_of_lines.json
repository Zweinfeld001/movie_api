      "I don't think so Captain.",
      "Please sir you can't take me to Ramelle I gotta go to Caen sir please I told you they make Caen lingerie there it's beautiful it's the best there is it's...oh please sir...",
      "No I'm not Kaback is honest. Or what about Faulkner? Or that little guy with the glasses?",
      "But sir...",
      "Captain can I ask you a question?",
      "Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan sir?",
      "Captain I gotta tell you the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.",
      "I should be on my way to Caen sir. It's like Beethoven the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf. Go figure I mean who'd he piss off? And here I am the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments one step away from Caen the center of the known lingerie universe and instead I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.",
      "Sir you know what Ramelle is famous for? Cheese. The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France. There is no bright side.",
      "I'm listening sir.",
      "General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you Captain.",
      "Jesus Christ he's a natural!",

      "Well sir in purely arithmetic terms since when does six equal one? What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?",
      "Huh?",
      "I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle sir. It's a personal thing.",
      "Easy for you to say sir. Fucking James Ryan I'd like to wring his fucking neck.",
      "Well maybe not the Captain but the rest of us have mothers.",
      "I'm sorry sir I apologize. But if you weren't a captain or if I were a major what would you say?",
      "Sir if you were not a captain I would compliment you now for being an excellent liar.",
      "Yes sir as a final note I'd like to say fuck our orders fuck Ramelle fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it fuck Private James Ryan.",
      "Sir I've got an idea let's go around.",
      "Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...",
      "I thought you said we had an hour sir?",
      "I've given this a lot of thought sir. The best thing that could happen is we find Ryan and he's dead.",
      "Well sir consider the possibilities. A: Ryan is alive. We have to take him back to the beach. Knowing you you don't let him carry my gear even though he really should and we all get killed trying to keep him alive.",
      "B: Ryan is dead. He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade whose name I know you don't want me to mention. There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea. We wander around looking for him until the Germans pick us off one after another.",
      "Neither do I sir. C: And this is the worst one we find Ryan and he's wounded. Not only does he not carry my gear we have to carry his gear. And him.",
      "Maybe. But what if he dies on the way back? you see what I'm saying sir? The best possible situation is he's dead we find his body more or less intact we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach or better yet we head over to Caen and catch up with division.",
      "No sir.",
      "Looks like tea time maybe they're Brits.",
      "Looks like they've been having a hell of a party here Captain.",
      "What if our guys open up sir?",
      "Have it your way Captain.",
      "Yes sir of course sir I was merely speaking hypothetically. IF this was a voting situation then the vote would have been unanimous. But of course it's not a voting situation you're the captain and you give the orders sir.",
      "Maybe Caen.",
      "Leave him to me Captain I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.",

It seems to me sir that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop smack-dab in the middle of Berlin Germany. Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high sir but it seems to me that saving one private no matter how grievous the losses of his family is a waste of my God-given talent.",
